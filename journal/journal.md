# 1701QCA Final project journal: Benjamin Davis

<!--- As for other assessments, fill out the following journal sections with information relevant to your project. --->

<!--- Markdown reference: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ --->

## Related projects ##
<!--- Find about 6 related projects to the project you choose. A project might be related through  function, technology, materials, fabrication, concept, or code. Don't forget to place an image of the related project in the appropriate folder and insert the filename in the appropriate places below. Copy the markdown block of code below for each project you are showing. --->

### Grenade-in-a-can ###

<!--- Modify code to insert image of related project below --->

<!--- Fill out name and link to related project in the code below. --->
two following projects(https://www.wearethemighty.com/articles/8-of-the-most-terrifying-vietnam-war-booby-traps)

tripwires are a fairly common trap, as such there are many examples of different tripwires. The first two examples are of real life tripwire traps used during the Vietnam war. This example is a common and simple tripwire trap that uses a cord tied to the pin of a grenade within a can. once the wire is tripped the pin is pulled out and the grenade explodes.

<!--- Repeat code above for a total of 6 related projects --->

### Bamboo Whip ###

<!--- Modify code to insert image of related project below --->

the second trap is a more complex example of a tripwire trap. It involves a bamboo pole with a mace or spikes attatched to the end, that, when the wire is tripped, the pole will be released, sending the mace swinging into the victim.

### door alarm ###

<!--- Fill out name and link to related project in the code below. --->
Door alarm(https://www.microbit.org/news/2020-05-18/microbit-at-home-door-alarm/)

this project is a similar type of device to the tripwire that I'll be making. It's a home made door alarm that instead uses a magnet to detect when the microbit is away from the door.

### Timing gates ###

<!--- Modify code to insert image of related project below --->

<!--- Fill out name and link to related project in the code below. --->
Timing gates(https://makecode.microbit.org/projects/timing-gates)

This project is also one that I have made for a previous assighnment as well. The construnction involves using tin foil to close a connection, then registering that in the microbit. The microbit then uses this info to find the speed of an object passing through the two points. This tripwire is similar in a couple of ways. Firstly this project also involves triggering something to happen after something goes past as well as having the trigger invole a piece of metal connecting two bits of tin foil.

### micro guardian ###

<!--- Modify code to insert image of related project below --->
![Image](microguardian.jpg)

<!--- Fill out name and link to related project in the code below. --->
Micro guardian(https://make.techwillsaveus.com/microbit/activities/micro-guardian-advanced)

this is another similar project that involves a microbit that detects when a signal is no longer being recieved and triggers an alarm, just like this tripwire project. this example uses two bits of copper attatched to a jar and its lid.

### using a buzzer ###

<!--- Modify code to insert image of related project below --->
![Image](piezo.jpg)

<!--- Fill out name and link to related project in the code below. --->
Piezo tutorial(https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sparkfun-inventors-kit-for-microbit-experiment-guide/experiment-9-using-a-buzzer)

this is a basic project that shows the basics of using a piezo buzzer.

## Other research ##
I did not use too many outside tutorials outside of the instruction manual that came with th inventors kit. The manual was used to find out how to attatch the buzzer and light to the breadboard. Otherwise, help was recieved from other people, including friends and family, instructors and peers.

## Conceptual development ##

### Design intent ###
<!--- Include your design intent here. It should be about a 10 word phrase/sentence. --->

### Design ideation ###
<!--- Document your ideation process. This will include the design concepts presented for assessment 2. You can copy and paste that information here. --->

### Final design concept ###
<!--- This should be a description of your concept including its context, motivation, or other relevant information you used to decide on this concept. --->

### Interaction flowchart ###
<!--- Include an interaction flowchart of the interaction process in your project. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible. --->

## Process documentation ##
<!--- In this section, include text and images (and potentially links to video) that represent the development of your project including sources you've found (URLs and written references), choices you've made, sketches you've done, iterations completed, materials you've investigated, and code samples. Use the markdown reference for help in formatting the material.

This should have quite a lot of information! It will likely include most of the process documentation from assessment 2 which can be copied and pasted here.

Use subheadings to structure this information. See https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ for details of how to insert subheadings.

There will likely by a dozen or so images of the project under construction. The images should help explain why you've made the choices you've made as well as what you have done. --->

## Final code ##

<!--- Include here screenshots of the final code you used in the project if it is done with block coding. If you have used javascript, micropython, C, or other code, include it as text formatted as code using a series of three backticks ` before and after the code block. See https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ for more information about that formatting. --->

## Design process discussion ##
<!--- Discuss your process used in this project, particularly with reference to aspects of the Double Diamond design methodology or other relevant design process. --->


## Reflection ##

<!--- Describe the parts of your project you felt were most successful and the parts that could have done with improvement, whether in terms of outcome, process, or understanding.

What techniques, approaches, skills, or information did you find useful from other sources (such as the related projects you identified earlier)?

What parts of your project do you feel are novel? This is IMPORTANT to help justify a key component of the assessment rubric.

What might be an interesting extension of this project? In what other contexts might this project be used? --->
